# Game of Nim

The main files of this program are

* main.py
* nim_controller.py
* nim_game.py
* nim_gui.py

An executable program can be found in the dist directory. This was created using PyInstaller.

The program only uses native python libraries so running main.py should work immediately after cloning the repo.

first_nim_script.py contains my first version of the program. This has less features than the gui version, but is still able to win a normal or misere game of nim.
